# Adding Usage Requirements for Library #

Usage requirements allow for far better control over a library / executables link and include line. While also giving more control over the transitive property of targets inside CMake. The primary commands that leverage usage requirements are:
  - target_compile_definitions
  - target_compile_options
  - target_include_directories
  - target_link_libraries

First up is MathFunctions. We first state that anybody linking to MathFunctions needs to include the current source directory, while MathFunctions it self doesn't. So this can become an INTERFACE usage requirement. Remember INTERFACE means, things
that consumers require but the producer doesn't.

  target_include_directories(MathFunctions
            INTERFACE ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR})

Now that we've specifed usage requirements for MathFunctions we can safely remove our uses of the EXTRA_INCLUDES variable.
