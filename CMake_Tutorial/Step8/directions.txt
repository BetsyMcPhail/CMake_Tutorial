# Adding Support for a Dashboard #

Adding support for submitting our test results to a dashboard is very easy. We already defined a number of tests for our project in the earlier steps of this tutorial. We just have to run those tests and submit them to a dashboard. To include support for dashboards we include the CTest module in our toplevel CMakeLists.txt.

  # enable testing
  enable_testing()

  # enable dashboard scripting
  include(CTest)

We also specify a CTestConfig.cmake file where we can specify the name of the project, and where to submit the dashboard.

  set(CTEST_PROJECT_NAME "CMakeTutorial")
  set(CTEST_NIGHTLY_START_TIME "01:00:00 UTC")

  set(CTEST_DROP_METHOD "http")
  set(CTEST_DROP_SITE "my.cdash.org/")
  set(CTEST_DROP_LOCATION "/submit.php?project=CMakeTutorial")
  set(CTEST_DROP_SITE_CDASH TRUE)

CTest will read in this file when it runs. To create a simple dashboard you can run CMake on your project, change directory to the binary tree, and then run ctest â€“D Experimental. The results of your dashboard will be uploaded to Kitware's public dashboard here https://my.cdash.org/index.php?project=CMakeTutorial.
